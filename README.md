⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/saas-ai-factory.git
cd saas-ai-factory/terraform

2. Configure Variables
Edit variables.tf or create a terraform.tfvars file with values like:
cloud_provider = "aws"  # or "azure" or "gcp"
project_name   = "my-saas-project"
tenant_id      = "tenant-123"

3. Initialize Terraform
terraform init

terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve

5. Access the Deployment
Once deployed, access the backend and frontend endpoints provided in the Terraform outputs.
6. Configure Secrets
Use Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to store sensitive credentials:
• Vault: configure access policies and secrets paths.
• AWS: use aws_secretsmanager_secret_version data source.
7. CI/CD Integration
Push changes to the main branch to trigger GitHub Actions:
• Automatically deploy infrastructure and app.

🔧 Key Features:
• Triggers on pushes to the main branch
• Matrix strategy for deploying multiple projects across AWS, Azure, and GCP
• Environment variables for secrets and cloud credentials
• Steps for terraform init, plan, and apply

✅ Your GitHub Actions workflow now includes Slack notifications for deployment status.
🔔 Notifications Added:
• ✅ Success: Sends a message when Terraform deployment completes successfully.
• ❌ Failure: Sends a message if the deployment fails.
To activate this:
1. Create a Slack Incoming Webhook via your Slack workspace.
2. Add the webhook URL to your GitHub repository secrets as SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL.

🔧 Step-by-Step: Create a Slack Incoming Webhook
1. Go to Slack API Settings
• Visit: https://api.slack.com/apps
• Click “Create New App”
• Choose From scratch, give it a name (e.g., SAAS AI FACTORY Bot), and select your workspace.
2. Enable Incoming Webhooks
• In the app settings sidebar, go to “Incoming Webhooks”
• Toggle “Activate Incoming Webhooks” to On
3. Create a Webhook URL
• Scroll down and click “Add New Webhook to Workspace”
• Choose the channel (e.g., #deployments) where you want notifications
• Click Allow
• Copy the generated Webhook URL
4. Add Webhook to GitHub Secrets
• Go to your GitHub repository
• Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
• Click “New repository secret”
• Name it SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
• Paste the webhook URL

✅ Manual Test via curl
You can test the webhook directly from your terminal:
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
--data '{"text":"🚀 Test message from SAAS AI FACTORY GitHub Actions workflow!"}' \
https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ

Replace https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ with your actual Slack webhook URL.
⸻
🔐 GitHub Actions Test
If you’ve already added the webhook to your GitHub repository secrets as SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, you can trigger a test by:
1. Making a small commit to the main branch (e.g., update README).
2. Watching the Actions tab for the workflow run.
3. Checking your Slack channel for the success or failure message.
